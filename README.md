Minesweeper - Console Mode

To play minesweeper, use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, and run the Main.java file.

How to play:

[d i j] will unveil a cell (i = row, j = column)

[m i j !/?/#] will mark a cell (! = mine (?), ? = don't know, # = reset marking)

[q] to leave the game and stop program.

You can change the number of rows, columns and number of mines of the grid in the Main.java file.




Good luck!
